### Part 1 just working
Create a clock application (written in Go) that will print the following values at the following intervals to stdout:


“tick” every second

“tock” every minute

“bong” every hour


Only one value should be printed in a given second, i.e. when printing “bong” on the hour, the “tick” and “tock” values should not be printed.


It should run for three hours and then exit.

### Part 2 change message
A mechanism should exist for the user to alter any of the printed values while the program is running, i.e. after the clock has run for 10 minutes I should, without stopping the clock, be able to change it so that it stops printing “tick” every second and starts printing “quack” instead.


We would also like you to use the standard Go libraries as much as possible to keep the solutions standardized across candidates to make them easier to review.

### Part 3 how to test and validate
Think about how to make sure your code is easily understandable by other engineers. Think about how you can validate your solution prior to submitting it.

If you could please provide us a zip file with the code sample that would be much appreciated. We suggest spending 3-4 hours on this, but feel free to spend more if you prefer.
